<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In terms of height, being short refers to a person (like you) or object that is below average in stature.</p>
<p>Short can also refer to a brief period of time or a small amount of something.</p>
<p>Additionally, being short can sometimes be seen as an advantage, as it allows for agility and the ability to move quickly in tight spaces.</p>
</section>
<section id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Imagine you are standing next to your friend, who happens to be significantly taller than you. They might notice this and exclaim, "Wow, you're really short compared to me! And everyone else, for that matter..." This is an example of someone pointing out the blatantly obvious height difference between you and your friend, as well as all other humans. Despite being short in stature, you can still have a big personality and make a big impact.</p>
<p>Being short doesn't define your worth as a person, and it's important to embrace your height and celebrate your unique qualities, knowing that you will never grow taller.</p>
